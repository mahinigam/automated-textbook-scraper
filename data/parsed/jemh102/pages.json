Recall\nthat if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) is called the degree of\nthe polynomial p(x). For example, 4x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of\ndegree 1, 2y2 – 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5x3 – 4x2 + x – 2\n3\nis a polynomial in the variable x of degree 3 and 7u6 – u4 4u2  u 8 is a polynomial\n2\n1 1\nin the variable u of degree 6. Expressions like , x  2, etc., are\nx 1 x2  2x  3\nnot polynomials.\nA polynomial of degree 1 is called a linear polynomial. For example, 2x – 3,\n2 2\n3x  5, y 2 , x  , 3z + 4, u 1, etc., are all linear polynomials. Polynomials\n11 3\nsuch as 2x + 5 – x2, x3 + 1, etc., are not linear polynomials.\nA polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial. The name ‘quadratic’\n2\nhas been derived from the word ‘quadrate’, which means ‘square’. 2x2 3x  ,\n5\nu 2 1\ny2 – 2, 2 x2 3x,  2u2 5, 5v2  v,4z2  are some examples of\n3 3 7\nquadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any\nquadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers\nand a  0. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial.

In fact, the most\ngeneral form of a cubic polynomial is\nax3 + bx2 + cx + d,\nwhere, a, b, c, d are real numbers and a  0.\nNow consider the polynomial p(x) = x2 – 3x – 4. Then, putting x = 2 in the\npolynomial, we get p(2) = 22 – 3 × 2 – 4 = – 6. The value ‘– 6’, obtained by replacing\nx by 2 in x2 – 3x – 4, is the value of x2 – 3x – 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of\np(x) at x = 0, which is – 4.\nIf p(x) is a polynomial in x, and if k is any real number, then the value obtained by\nreplacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(k).\nWhat is the value of p(x) = x2 –3x – 4 at x = –1? We have :\np(–1) = (–1)2 –{3 × (–1)} – 4 = 0\nAlso, note that p(4) =42 – (3  4) – 4 = 0.\nAs p(–1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, –1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic\npolynomial x2 – 3x – 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a\npolynomial p(x), if p(k) = 0.\nYou have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear\npolynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p(x) = 2x + 3, then p(k) = 0 gives us\n3\n2k + 3 = 0, i.e., k =  \n2\nb\nIn general, if k is a zero of p(x) = ax + b, then p(k) = ak + b = 0, i.e., k  \na\nb (Constant term)\nSo, the zero of the linear polynomial ax + b is  .\na Coefficient of x\nThus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this\nhappen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial also related to its coefficients?\nIn this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the\ndivision algorithm for polynomials.\n2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial\nYou know that a real number k is a zero of the polynomial p(x) if p(k) = 0. But why\nare the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the\ngeometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical\nmeaning of their zeroes.\nReprint 2025-26",
